## Game Concept

The Item Pickup Survival Game (IPSG) is a minimalist survival game set in a confined cube room. The player must manage their resources and find a chest to escape. The objective is simple: survive by managing hunger and thirst while searching for the chest to end the game.

The concept is inspired by classic survival games and minimalist game design principles. The focus is on simplicity, making it accessible for players and feasible for development within a short timeframe.
